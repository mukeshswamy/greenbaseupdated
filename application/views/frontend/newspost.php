				"Growth in e-commerce has led to a demand for temporary warehouses, with occupiers seeking alternative sites to service customers better, even as prospects remain good for the sector",
            article:[
                "With e-commerce driving the logistics sector in the time of Covid-19, there has been a spike in demand for temporary warehouses, signalling a structural shift in the approach of companies and investors even as the overall sentiment remains positive. While industrial leasing in the top eight cities of India stood at 11 million sq feet in the first half of 2020, the pandemic has led to demand growing for warehouses with a lease tenure of 6-11 months",
                "Occupiers are looking for alternative locations as it helps in continuity of business and mitigates delays in delivery. The urban logistics sector is thus considering conventional retail spaces, banquet and marriage halls for alternative use as city warehouses. Besides there are upcoming markets like Guwahati, Lucknow, Patna, Jaipur, Coimbatore, Rajpura, Indore, Vijayawada, Hosur and Kochi on which the sector is focussing, seeking to enlarge its footprint. Growth prospects for these markets have brightened with the government unveiling the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme which aims at self-reliance.",
                "Yogesh Shevade, head — Industrial Services, JLL India, an investment and real estate management firm, says the challenge posed by Covid-19 has made large companies consider outsourcing supply chain management for the sake of efficiency. With realtors shifting their focus to development of logistics real estate, manufacturing firms are trying to get space on lease, seeking ‘ready to occupy and built to suit industrial spaces’ with higher specifications and pre-approved usage.",
                "As for investors, there is a growing trend towards acquisition of logistics platforms rather than individual assets. The investment of Rs 380 crore by global private equity (PE) giant Blackstone in the Mumbai-based AllCargo Logistics and the PE company’s tie-up with the Hiranandani Group’s GreenBase to build industrial warehousing across India, entailing an investment of Rs 2,500 crore, illustrate this trend. Although these deals were struck before the lockdown, the mood guiding them has persisted, albeit with some change in approach. Investors are trying to gain captive tenant networks and achieve scale, the scope for which is large in India.",
                "Says Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head India, JLL, “while growth of the logistics sector in value terms is likely to slow down and there may be yield contraction in some markets, investor confidence and capital values are expected to remain intact.” In fact, the growth of internet penetration rates, expansion of online grocery and omni-channel retailing and integration of technology with warehousing and storage which the pandemic has fuelled, augurs well for logistics real estate as an asset class. At $195 billion, industrial and logistics real estate is already the second largest asset class globally.",
                "According to a JLL report, the reimagination of the logistics sector is making occupiers embrace technology, innovative solutions, modern processes and digital transformation to meet evolving consumer habits. Vital in this context is the low e-commerce penetration in India– a mere 5%, as against online retail sale accounting for 14% of global retail sales in 2019. Its rapid growth in the coming years will push the creation of suburb warehouses, in-city warehouses, tier-1 and tier-2 city warehouses and multi-storied warehouses, the report says. For instance, this trend is on ample display at Dulaghar in Howrah—which is growing fast as a global trading hub for readymade garments— with a number of multi-storied warehouses having come up and many more at the development stage.",

                "A senior official said the Strengthening Guidance (Tamil Nadu’s nodal agency for investment promotion and single window facilitation) team has helped the State bring in more investments. “The CM has been personally viewing each project or firm that evinces interest to invest in Tamil Nadu. These two formulas have worked out well,” he said. According to Neeraj Mittal, MD and CEO of Guidance, “The teams (Guidance, Industries Department and Sipcot) have been working 24/7 and we have broadened the scope of picking up leads. The CM is also reviewing all investment proposals that come in. And this has helped bring in more investment.”",
                "Tamil Nadu’s excellent industrial ecosystem, trained manpower, connectivity, connected supply chains and pragmatic policies allows investors to take advantage of global realignment of value chains, he said.",

                " Niranjan Hiranandani, founder of real estate developer Hiranandani group, comments on his plans for expansion and diversification into logistics, as well as possible collaborations with overseas companies in real estate, which comes despite the ongoing economic slowdown.",
                "In December 2019, Greenbase, a unit of Hiranandani group, entered into an equal joint venture with Blackstone Investments Group for the development of logistics and industrial parks across India. Edited excerpts:",
                "Post the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), we thought that there is an opportunity for logistics platforms. We ourselves put three projects into the platform. One was in Talegaon in Pune, which was 250 acres or thereof. The second project is of 110 acres in Chennai at Oragadam.",
                "The third project is in Nashik, which is of 77 acres. Now we are going to put new projects in four more locations into the platform—Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Gurugram and Durgapur.",
                "These are logistics parks, which will have warehousing and also be industrial parks. We have already signed one agreement with (wind-turbine maker) Vestas for 30 acres in Chennai (suburb) Oragadam. We have finalized an industrial park with them, which will come up in the next one year. We are in the process of signing two transactions in Pune. In the next 10 years, opportunity in logistics and industrial parks is going to be robust. Blackstone was very enthusiastic to join hands with us and we expect to invest ₹2,500 crore in the next two years on this platform. Every e-commerce player is interested in logistics. Even other sectors are looking interesting. Let us look at people such as Ikea. They would like to see deliveries done the next day for all the CKD (completely knocked down) goods that are there.",
                "We think Blackstone has enough relationships to bring in any global best practices to us (in logistics). Brookfield invested a billion dollars in 2017 and we expect that in the next one or two years we will have some more foreign funds co-invest with us in projects other than Blackstone. So may be about half a dozen or so are in talks with us. None of the transactions are likely to be of less than half a billion to a billion dollars. We think there are possibilities of investments coming in of more than a billion dollars. It could be as soon as 12 months. Deals may be signed any time worthy offerings are made. All these are in the real estate space.",
                "As far as the volume of money is concerned I don’t think that has reduced. However, maybe in the last two years it has not increased. Earlier it would increase every year.",

                "GreenBase, a fully owned subsidiary of India’s leading real estate conglomerate, Hiranandani Group,  Niranjan Hiranandani initiative, has inked a joint venture with Blackstone Investments Group to set up a 50:50 joint venture, a Hiranandani-Blackstone pan-India platform for development of industrial, logistics and warehousing assets.",
                "The strategic move comes in sync with opportunities created by structural reforms like GST, improved road infrastructure as also the Make in India initiative among others, which augur well for the industrial and logistics sector. “There could be short-term hiccups, which happens in every economy, but we are certainly on path for India to become a $5 trillion economy,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, founder & MD, Hiranandani Group. “We have a very bullish view on the economy in the long term. Logistics and warehousing will be one of the major beneficiaries of this growth. The JV’s investment (estimated to be Rs 2,500 crores over the next 3-4 years) will also contribute to economic growth as well as employment generation in the relevant locations,” he added.",
                "The JV will initially include Hiranandani Green Base’s 267 acres in Pune, 115 acres in Chennai’s industrial suburb Oragadam, 73 acres in Nashik and around 25 acres in Durgapur, West Bengal.",
                "The quantum of investment projected through the JV is estimated as both the entities investing over Rs 2,500 crores initially to develop the 12 million sq-ft industrial and warehousing assets portfolio of Hiranandani’s logistics venture GreenBase and additional assets to be built up coming through acquisitions of land or warehousing assets in other locations.The USP will be ‘customer delight’, which is true to our tradition, said N Shridhar, group director and CEO, infrastructure (industrial and logistics). “Greenbase has got into this business since the last two years to build ‘grade A’, world class infrastructure and BTS assets. Greenbase over the last year, has successfully closed customer transactions worth 1 million sq-ft for BTS at our locations, with end-users such as Coopers (for Talegaon) and Vestas (at Oragadam), while a few others are on the drawing board - some more to follow,” he added.",
                "Given that logistics cost which at 13 % of GDP in India, is higher as compared to the western world where it is at 8% of GDP or so, there is ample opportunity in this sector to deliver optimised supply chain solutions and logistics/warehousing solutions, which bring down the cost and add value to the customers as well as corporates.",
                "Hiranandani along with Blackstone will usher in an excellent value proposition to the end customers and deliver quality infrastructure at optimised value, effectively, creating value for the entity as well for the country.",

                "The newly established vertical ‘GreenBase’, the brain-child of Dr Niranjan Hiranandani will provide industrial and logistics parks which will be more customer-centric and build optimisation and efficiency for the end user. At Oragadam, GreenBase is creating and facilitating an industrial and logistics park of global standards. Given the Hiranandani Group’s track record in terms of its rich legacy and strength in developing mega, mixed-use integrated townships along with development of core infrastructure, the new development in the Logistics sector by GreenBase will dove-tail perfectly into the Group’s activities.",
                "Vestas India is setting up an assembly and warehousing facility, which will be spread over 23 acres at the Park. This project by Vestas will result in creation of new jobs as also business opportunities for allied and ancillary industrial units, and will give a big fillip to development of the industrial and manufacturing sector in Oragadam, said Dr iranjan Hiranandani, co-founder and MD, Hiranandani Group.",
                "“The Indian Government has also granted infrastructure status to the logistic industry, making it an even more positive situation. These are favorable reasons, which provide an impetus to diversify and foray into the industrial and logistics sector,” he added.",
                "The Group has allocated 115 acres for the Industrial and Logistics Park out of 430 acres of the mixed used integrated township, Hiranandani Parks in Oragadam, Chennai. The acreage is dry land, and is suitable for industrial and logistics usage. It offers strategic advantages, including provision of STP, power substation, security cabin, boundary wall etc. Infrastructure and security for the industrial parks has been well planned and executed.",
                "For end-users, the required core infrastructure in form of required water and uninterrupted power are available at the Industrial and Logistics Park.

                "In mid-April, Albinder Dhindsa, the co-founder of grocery e-tailer Grofers, found himself in a tricky situation. The company’s top team—including the supply chain head—was stuck in a Gurugram township that got earmarked as a containment zone. And demand for grocery was skyrocketing. “Initially, we could let one out of eight customers check out, Dhindsa told Mint, adding that “traffic now is 25-30 times of what it was in February.",
                "The Grofers management team worked remotely, scrambling to add both workforce and warehousing capacity over the following weeks. The company ran 26 warehouses before the lockdown. It quickly added three more as demand spiked in April. Another five will open over the next two weeks. “These are smaller facilities. The warehouses were already built, which we are repurposing for our use, Dhindsa said.",
                "Warehousing, or sheds where goods are stored, have become crucial in the post-covid world. Inside, storage racks can go up to five levels. If you can’t store enough, you cannot meet the demand and neither can you deliver fast. Most crucially, additional warehouses will now allow firms such as Grofers to create a buffer of goods.",
                "Many warehousing complexes are expected to come up across India, more so in the post-covid world. Many e-commerce categories are expected to boom, as people make a behavioural shift from buying offline to shopping online.",
                "Also, over the next couple of years, industrial warehousing is expected to see a sunrise as (as some expect) manufacturing shifts out of China. India wants to be prepared—developers, particularly. They are building warehouses at a frantic pace, often with private equity (PE) booty.",
                "As things stand, across eight Indian cities—NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad—quality warehousing stock totalled 211 million sq. ft in 2019. The stock is expected to rise to 253 million sq. ft this year and further to nearly 300 million sq. ft in 2021, JLL, a real estate services firm, projected.",
                "“There is little vacancy. Of the 211 million sq. ft, about 21 million sq. ft is vacant today, said Chandranath Dey, head of industrial operations, business development and industrial consulting at JLL India. Who stands to gain from this warehousing rush? And how real, and long-lasting are the assumptions behind this investment spree to build large sheds across India?",
                "Much of the new warehouses going live this year are sophisticated top-quality stuff. Such quality comes at a cost and increasingly, warehousing is becoming a big boy’s club. In April 2019, the Hiranandani Group set up a new company, GreenBase, which has entered into a joint venture with PE major Blackstone Group to build logistics and warehousing assets. The company has invested ₹500 crore.",

                "A mere hour with Niranjan Hiranandani is not enough. The czar of real estate has been in the business of real estate for far too long and, one can safely say, has learnt everything there is to know under the sun. He has also learnt to take everything in his stride, which is of paramount importance in the perennially shifting arena of real estate development.",
                "What makes him distinct in the unsporting world of real estate is his ability to be direct and outspoken. Be it government rules or the dynamically shifting nature of the development business, Hiranandani has remained true to his conscience at all times. Perhaps, it’s this reason that also makes him much sought after across industries. Besides being co-founder and MD at the Hiranandani Group, and CMD of Hiranandani Communities, he is also the national president of Naredco, the president of the apex industry body Assocham (The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India) and in January was appointed as one of the board members to find a resolution for Unitech. He considers this role as a public service to resolve the issues of numerous stranded home buyers.",
                "All the above responsibilities, while being a feather in his cap, rests lightly on his able shoulders.",
                "Set up in 1978, the Hiranandani Group is perchance the only developer to have a reputation for building an entire ’district’, Hiranandani Gardens, what is also known as Powai. Not only did it create townships and give citizens their early taste for luxury apartments, it also offered, and continues to offer, buyers a lifestyle option that was hitherto absent. Strangely, people in the 80s and 90s had not realised its absence. Hiranandani says, “That’s the beauty of townships. It offers people alternatives from the routine lifestyle they had been used to. It helps them grow and learn as an individual and as a family. As a Group, we will continue to focus on development of townships, while building on iconic structures that we are known for.”",
                "Today, the Group has a presence in Chennai, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, and there is constant search for new locations that will fit in with its hallmark design mantra.",
                "Over the years, the Group has diversified to education, hospitality, healthcare, retail and entertainment. Hiranandani believes in moving with the times. Moreover, his belief also stems from not only doing the right thing at the right time, but doing it well.",

The degrowth that came as an offshoot of the global financial crash of 2008-'09, and later developments like the hyperactivity of 'fly-by-night' operators, rule changes like RERA and not to mention de-monetisation. For example, according to Anarock, sales fell by half across the top seven cities in the country in the first half of this year, compared to the last 6sixmonths of 2019.",

But COVID-19 might just have put paid to that. With Work-From-Home, staggered attendance proving themselves to be more than just a passing fad, it is all but clear that the good times are over for big ticket office deals in the real estate space.",

According to a report unveild by Knight Frank on Thursday, warehousing transactions have risen by leaps and bounds in the recent past. Demand growth has been healthy in all leading Indian cities, with growth in cities like Patna and Jaipur at over 200 per cent in 2020. ",
                "The national capital region, the biggest market for warehousing, saw the largest volume absorption of warehousing space, with Mumbai and Pune not too far behind.
